# ComputerVision

This repository is intended to create several mini-projects involving computer vision.

### Project 1 - Smart Light Control using Hand Gestures
This project will utilise the mediapipe library to track and analyse hand gestures. Then, it will map certain gestures to commands that control a Meross smart lamp.   
- Initial stage - control the lamp by clicking on on-screen virtual buttons. [COMPLETED]
- Second stage - control the lamp by performing certain hand gestures without any on-screen buttons. [PENDING]
- Final stage - integrate code onto a raspberry pi with a camera module and control the lamp without access to a display. [PENDING]
